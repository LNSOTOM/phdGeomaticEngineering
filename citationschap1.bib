  abstract = {Remotely sensed ground cover maps are routinely validated using field data collected by observers who classify ground cover into defined categories such as photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), bare soil (BS), and rock. There is an element of subjectivity to the classification of PV and NPV, and classifications may differ between observers. An alternative is to estimate ground cover based on in situ hyperspectral reflectance measurements (HRM). This study examines observer consistency when classifying vegetation samples of wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Gladius) covering the full range of photosynthetic activity, from completely senesced (0\% PV) to completely green (100\% PV), as photosynthetic or non-photosynthetic. We also examine how the classification of spectra of the same vegetation samples compares to the observer results. We collected HRM and photographs, over two months, to capture the transition of wheat leaves from 100\% PV to 100\% NPV. To simulate typical field methodology, observers viewed the photographs and classified each leaf as either PV or NPV, while spectral unmixing was used to decompose the HRM of the leaves into proportions of PV and NPV. The results showed that when a leaf was {$\leq$}25\% or {$\geq$}75\% PV observers tended to agree, and assign the leaf to the expected category. However, as leaves transitioned from PV to NPV (i.e., PV {$\geq$} 25\% but {$\leq$} 75\%) observers' decisions differed more widely and their classifications showed little agreement with the spectral proportions of PV and NPV. This has significant implications for the reliability of data collected using binary methods in areas containing a significant proportion of vegetation in this intermediate range such as the over/underestimation of PV and NPV vegetation and how reliably this data can then be used to validate remotely sensed products.},

  abstract = {Mosses, the dominant flora of East Antarctica, show evidence of drying in recent decades, likely due to the regional effects of climate change. Given the relatively small area that such moss beds occupy, new tools are needed to map and monitor these fragile ecosystems in sufficient detail. In this study, we collected low altitude aerial photography with a small multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Structure from Motion (SfM) computer vision techniques were applied to derive ultra-high resolution 3D models from multi-view aerial photography. A 2cm~digital surface model (DSM) and 1cm~orthophoto mosaic were derived from the 3D model and aerial photographs, respectively. The geometric accuracy of the orthophoto and DSM was 4cm. A weighted contributing upstream area was derived with the D-infinity algorithm, based on the DSM and a snow cover map derived from the orthophoto. The contributing upstream area was used as a proxy for water availability from snowmelt, one of the key environmental drivers of moss health. A Monte Carlo simulation with 300 realisations was implemented to model the impact of error in the DSM on runoff direction. Significant correlations were found between these simulated water availability values and field measurements of moss health and water content. In the future ultra-high spatial resolution DSMs acquired with a UAV could thus be used to determine the impact of changing snow cover on the health and spatial distribution of polar vegetation non-destructively.},

  abstract = {The rapid anthropogenic climate change that is being experienced in the early twenty-first century is intimately entwined with the health and functioning of the biosphere. Climate change is impacting ecosystems through changes in mean conditions and in climate variability, coupled with other associated changes such as increased ocean acidification and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. It also interacts with other pressures on ecosystems, including degradation, defaunation and fragmentation. There is a need to understand the ecological dynamics of these climate impacts, to identify hotspots of vulnerability and resilience and to identify management interventions that may assist biosphere resilience to climate change. At the same time, ecosystems can also assist in the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. The mechanisms, potential and limits of such nature-based solutions to climate change need to be explored and quantified. This paper introduces a thematic issue dedicated to the interaction between climate change and the biosphere. It explores novel perspectives on how ecosystems respond to climate change, how ecosystem resilience can be enhanced and how ecosystems can assist in addressing the challenge of a changing climate. It draws on a Royal Society-National Academy of Sciences Forum held in Washington DC in November 2018, where these themes and issues were discussed. We conclude by identifying some priorities for academic research and practical implementation, in order to maximize the potential for maintaining a diverse, resilient and well-functioning biosphere under the challenging conditions of the twenty-first century.             This article is part of the theme issue `Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.},

  abstract = {Vegetation cover is a key environmental variable often mapped from satellite and aerial imagery. The derivation of ultra-high spatial resolution fractional vegetation cover (FVC) based on multispectral imagery acquired from an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) has several applications, including the potential to revolutionise the collection of field data for calibration/validation of satellite products. In this study, abundance maps were derived using three methods, applied to data collected in a typical Australian rangeland environment. The first method used downscaling between Landsat FVC maps and UAS images with Random Forest regression to predict bare ground, photosynthetic vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation cover. The second method used spectral unmixing based on endmembers identified in the multispectral imagery. The third method used an object-based classification approach to label image segments. The accuracy of all UAS FVC and Landsat FVC products were assessed using 20 field plots (100 m diameter star transects), as well as from 138 ground photo plots. The classification method performed best for all cover fractions at the 100 m plot scale (12\textendash 13\% RMSE), with the downscaling approach only able to accurately predict photosynthetic cover. The downscaling and unmixing generally over-predicted non-photosynthetic vegetation associated with Chenopod shrubs. When compared with the high-resolution photo plot data, the classification method performed the worst, while the downscaling and unmixing methods achieved reasonable accuracy for the photosynthetic component only (12\textendash 13\% RMSE). Multispectral UAS imagery has great potential for mapping photosynthetic vegetation cover in rangelands at ultra-high resolution, though accurately separating non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare ground was only possible when the data was scaled-up to coarser resolutions.},

  abstract = {The estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) by using remote sensing images has become feasible. Based on Landsat8-OLI images and field data obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle, we established an empirical model (EM) and a pixel decomposition model (PDM) of FVC in the desert vegetation region, steppe vegetation region, meadow vegetation region and mixed vegetation region (the three vegetation region types) of the Qaidam Basin, and the inversion accuracies of the models were compared. The results show the following: (1) Vegetation classification inversion (VCI) provides a promising approach for FVC estimation. The accuracy of FVC by VCI was obviously better than that achieved using vegetation mixed inversion (VMI); (2) Differences were observed in the FVC estimation between VCI and VMI by the EM in areas with relatively high-density vegetation cover (FVC {$>$} 60\%). The FVC in some parts of steppe region in the basin was slightly overestimated by VMI of the EM; 3) VCI estimated by the PDM resulted in lower inversion values for extremely low-density vegetation cover (FVC {$\leq$} 10\%) and higher inversion values for high-density vegetation cover (FVC {$>$} 80\%). The FVC inversion was underestimated by the PDM in steppe and meadow regions with FVC {$>$} 15\% in the basin. The application of VCI in different models can provide new ideas for the sustainable study of vegetation in arid regions.},
