\section*{Abstract}

% As technologies and computer storage capacity develops, there are ever increasing amounts of data available for us to use.  Despite this increase in available data, historically there have been limited benefits from it because of the issues involved in analysis of such large quantities because traditional statistical techniques are slow to process such large volumes. The recent development of machine learning algorithms and cloud technologies presents an unique opportunity to process these volumes of data, and have the potential to provide much greater accuracy and model predictive power in output results. 

% In this study, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and cloud base systems have been used to assess the key drivers of forest productivity in radiata pine plantations in Tasmania. Data on 23 predictor variables known to impact forest productivity were collated, including climate, topographic and edaphic variables, and used these to test the accuracy of 5 different MLAs - Linear regression (LM), Polynomial regression (Poly\_reg), Decision Trees Regression (DTree), Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBDT). It was found that the best model was GBDT, which had predictive power of $>$ 0.845 for unseen data, although the other methods also proved successful with predictive powers of 0.85 (RF) and 0.703 (DTree) respectively. In these three most accurate models, rainfall was the most important factor driving forest productivity, followed by the topographic position index (TPI), geology composition (SYMBOL) and aspect landscape attribute.

% The outputs of models varied from model to model, and it was proven that adding a certain amount of complexity improves the quality of the model. This complexity allows a better understanding of the relationship between features and the interactions with the target variable. Tuning the model complexity is key to improving the data fitting process resulting in more accurate models.

% This work is important in demonstrating the usefullness of MLAs and cloud based systems to improve the accuracy and the efficiency of assessments and predictions using big data.
