  abstract = {Wetland vegetation plays a key role in the ecological functions of wetland environments. Remote sensing techniques offer timely, up-to-date, and relatively accurate information for sustainable and effective management of wetland vegetation. This article provides an overview on the status of remote sensing applications in discriminating and mapping wetland vegetation, and estimating some of the biochemical and biophysical parameters of wetland vegetation. Research needs for successful applications of remote sensing in wetland vegetation mapping and the major challenges are also discussed. The review focuses on providing fundamental information relating to the spectral characteristics of wetland vegetation, discriminating wetland vegetation using broad- and narrow-bands, as well as estimating water content, biomass, and leaf area index. It can be concluded that the remote sensing of wetland vegetation has some particular challenges that require careful consideration in order to obtain successful results. These include an in-depth understanding of the factors affecting the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and wetland vegetation in a particular environment, selecting appropriate spatial and spectral resolution as well as suitable processing techniques for extracting spectral information of wetland vegetation.},

  abstract = {Habitat mapping is an essential descriptor to monitor and manage natural or semi-natural ecosystems. Habitats integrate both the environmental conditions and the related biodiversity. However, it remains challenging to map certain habitats such as inland wetlands due to spectral, spatial and temporal variability in the vegetation cover. Currently, no satellite constellations optimize the spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions required to map wetlands according to the habitats discriminated from in situ surveys. Our approach aims to combine satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to exceed their respective limitations. Both data sources were combined through a spectral unmixing algorithm with the hypothesis that endmembers from UAV data are pure enough to enhance plant community abundances estimated from satellite data. The experiment was conducted on the regional preserve of the Soug\'eal marsh, a wet grassland of 174~ha located upstream of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay. Two satellite data sources - Sentinel-2 and Pleiades - and three acquisition periods - November 2017, April 2018 and May 2018 - were considered. A reference map of plant community distribution was produced from UAV multitemporal data and floristic surveys to validate the unmixing of satellite data. This study shows innovative results and perspectives: while UAV can improve habitat discrimination, results vary among acquisition periods and habitats. Results illustrate well the great potential of combined UAV and satellite data but also demonstrate the influence of endmembers on the unmixing process and technical limitations (e.g. spectral mismatches between sensors), which can be overcome using domain adaptation.},

The former is frequently used for its acquisition flexibility and its ability to supply imagery with very high spatial resolution (VHSR); the latter is interesting for supplying time-series data over large areas. However, each of these data sources is generally used separately even though they are complementary and have strong and promising potential synergies. Data fusion is a well-known technique to exploit this multi-source synergy, but in practice, UAV and satellite synergies are more specific, less well known and need to be formalized. In this article, we review remote sensing studies that addressed both data sources. Current approaches were categorized to distinguish four strategies: ``data comparison'', ``multiscale explanation'', ``model calibration'' and ``data fusion''. Analysis of the literature revealed emerging trends, the supply of these distinct strategies for several applications and allowed to identify key contributions of UAV data. Finally, the high potential of this synergy seems currently under-exploited; therefore a discussion is proposed about the related implications for data interoperability, machine learning and data sharing to reinforce synergies between UAVs and satellites.},

Combining calibrated hyperspectral imagery with inverse physically based reflectance models is an interesting approach for estimating chlorophyll concentrations that are good indicators of vegetation health. The objective of this study was to develop a novel approach for retrieving chlorophyll a and b values from remotely sensed data by inverting the stochastic model of leaf optical properties using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. The inversion results and retrieved values are validated in two ways: A classical machine learning validation dataset and calculating chlorophyll maps from empirical remotely sensed hyperspectral data and comparing them to     TCARI OSAVI    , an index that has strong negative correlation with chlorophyll concentration. With the validation dataset, coefficients of determination (    R 2    ) of 0.97 were obtained for chlorophyll a and 0.95 for chlorophyll b. The chlorophyll maps correlate with the     TCARI OSAVI     map. The correlation coefficient (R) is -0.87 for chlorophyll a and -0.68 for chlorophyll b in selected plots. These results indicate that the approach is highly promising approach for estimating vegetation chlorophyll content.},

  abstract = {This study presents a comparative study of multispectral and RGB (red, green, and blue) sensor-based cotton canopy cover modelling using multi-temporal unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) imagery. Additionally, a canopy cover model using an RGB sensor is proposed that combines an RGB-based vegetation index with morphological closing. The field experiment was established in 2017 and 2018, where the whole study area was divided into approximately 1 x 1 m size grids. Grid-wise percentage canopy cover was computed using both RGB and multispectral sensors over multiple flights during the growing season of the cotton crop. Initially, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based canopy cover was estimated, and this was used as a reference for the comparison with RGB-based canopy cover estimations. To test the maximum achievable performance of RGB-based canopy cover estimation, a pixel-wise classification method was implemented. Later, four RGB-based canopy cover estimation methods were implemented using RGB images, namely Canopeo, the excessive greenness index, the modified red green vegetation index and the red green blue vegetation index. The performance of RGB-based canopy cover estimation was evaluated using NDVI-based canopy cover estimation. The multispectral sensor-based canopy cover model was considered to be a more stable and accurately estimating canopy cover model, whereas the RGB-based canopy cover model was very unstable and failed to identify canopy when cotton leaves changed color after canopy maturation. The application of a morphological closing operation after the thresholding significantly improved the RGB-based canopy cover modeling. The red green blue vegetation index turned out to be the most efficient vegetation index to extract canopy cover with very low average root mean square error (2.94\% for the 2017 dataset and 2.82\% for the 2018 dataset), with respect to multispectral sensor-based canopy cover estimation. The proposed canopy cover model provides an affordable alternate of the multispectral sensors which are more sensitive and expensive.},

Science, 105, 367\textendash 368, and is thus an ideal testing ground for remote sensing studies of ecosystem function and structure. We tested the generality of imaging spectroscopy with ``tied'' red-edge and shortwave-infrared (RE-SWIR2) spectral mixture modeling for automated analysis of the lateral distribution of plant tissues and bare substrate across diverse bioclimatic gradients in Hawai'i. Unique quantities of the fractional cover of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV, NPV) and bare substrate identified fundamental differences in ecosystem structure across life zones. There was a {$\sim$}20-fold increase in fractional PV cover with a 10-fold increase in mean annual precipitation ({$\leq$}250\textendash 2000 mm year-1). This rate of increase diminished from 2000 to 3000 mm year-1 of rainfall, suggesting that photosynthetic canopy cover may be limited by water saturation at 3000 mm year-1. The amount of exposed surface senescent material (NPV) remained nearly constant at {$\sim$}50\% in ecosystems with a mean annual precipitation {$<$}1500 mm year-1. Thereafter, NPV steadily declined to a minimum of {$\sim$}20\% at 3000 mm year-1 of rainfall. Bare substrate fractions were highest ({$\sim$}50\%) at precipitation levels {$<$}750 mm year-1, then declined to {$<$}20\% in the 750\textendash 1000 mm year-1 zones. The combination of low bare substrate and high NPV cover in the 750\textendash 1000 mm year-1 rainfall zones identified these areas as high fire risk. Remotely sensed fractional cover of PV+NPV was poorly correlated with canopy leaf area index (LAI), showing the uniqueness of the lateral structural measurement afforded by automated RE-SWIR2 spectroscopy approaches. The results indicate the accuracy, precision and applicability of imaging spectroscopy for ecological research across a wide range of bioclimatic conditions.},

This study also examines the inter-annual variation of vegetation indices and lag effects of climate variables (temperature and precipitation) using simple regression and correlation approaches. Results indicate that the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) were significantly correlated with the mean temperature, whereby the value of NDVI increases with a decrease in temperature and value of NDSI increases with an increase in temperature. On examining seasonal variations, our findings indicated that the months of August and September have the highest mean NDVI values. This study confirms that consistently rising temperature and altered precipitation patterns have exerted a strong influence on temporal distributions and productivities of the terrestrial ecosystems of the Tolon and Wa-West districts of Ghana. Furthermore, this research demonstrates how vegetation indices can be used as an indicator to monitor phenological changes in the terrestrial ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Coral reef degradation due to environmental change, including anthropogenic disturbances, is a major concern worldwide. Detecting and assessing both temporal and spatial changes in benthic cover is a crucial requirement to inform policy makers and guide conservation measures. Here, we introduce a spatial approach based on high resolution multispectral and hyperspectral image analysis, developed in order to detect and quantify changes in benthic cover in a highly heterogeneous shallow coral reef flat in Reunion Island in the South-West Indian Ocean. We propose a new index called HCAI (Hyperspectral Coral to Algae Index), defined as the ratio of living coral cover to the sum of living coral and algal covers. Benthic cover estimates were derived from airborne hyperspectral image processing using water column correction and unmixing models implemented with the four main coral reef benthic components: corals, algae, seagrass and sand. Ground truth and LIDAR data acquired simultaneously were used to validate processing accuracy. A significant positive correlation (adjusted R2 = 0.72, p-value {$<$} 0.001) was obtained between coral cover recorded in situ and estimated from image analysis. Moreover, 13 habitat classes based on the four main benthic component covers were mapped at a scale of an entire reef. Diachronic analyses of hyperspectral images between 2009 and 2015 revealed an overall decrease of the HCAI index and a decrease in the area of all the dominant coral classes along the reef (-28.24\% for the coral class for example), while the area of habitat classes dominated by algae strongly increased during the same period. Moreover, we detected and documented the spatial and temporal evolutions of coral geomorphological features composed with coral rubble deposits called rubble tongues (RTs) using different available sensors (i.e. hyperspectral, satellite, and orthophotography). Since 2003, four detected (RTs) have spread shoreward at a mean rate of 8.4 m.y-1 including significant loss of reef structural complexity and heterogeneity, a spreading pattern which was confirmed by 2009 and 2015 hyperspectral data. Remote sensing and more specifically airborne hyperspectral approaches open new perspectives for coral reef monitoring, at high temporal and spatial resolutions.},

However, the specificity introduced by the coexistence of spectral and spatial content in the RS data sets widens the scope of the challenges presented to adapt DL methods to these contexts. Therefore, the aim of this paper is first to explore the performance of DL architectures for the RS hyperspectral data set classification and second to introduce a new 3-D DL approach that enables a joint spectral and spatial information process. A set of 3-D schemes is proposed and evaluated. Experimental results based on well-known hyperspectral data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve a better classification rate than state-of-the-art methods with lower computational costs.},

  abstract = {Species composition has been studied extensively in different ecosystems for investigating biodiversity and evaluating ecosystem health conditions. Remote sensing imagery is an important data source for investigating species composition, owing to its large spatial coverage and continuous data acquisition. However, commonly-used remote sensing images acquired by satellite (e.g., Landsat, Quickbird) or airplane have a spatial resolution lower than 0.5m, and are thus not capable of resolving characteristically small features. This poses a particular challenge in grassland ecosystems, since grassland species are typically small in size and highly mixed. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an emerging technology in recent decades that can acquire imagery with ultra-high spatial resolution (sub-decimeter). Therefore, UAV-acquired imagery facilitates fine-scale species classification. This study classified two UAV-acquired images obtained at different times during the vegetation-growing cycle for species investigation in a temperate grassland. The classification approach utilized in this process was object-oriented classification, which is capable of identifying ground covers using spectral, spatial, and textural information. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was applied for feature selection, which is an essential step in determining optimal features for classifiers. The dominant species in the study area were classified with an overall accuracy higher than 80\%. Spatial and temporal variations of dominant species were analyzed, and their potential influencing factors (e.g., topographic condition, soil moisture) were also examined. Challenges of using UAV-acquired imagery and the objectoriented technique for species classification were summarized at the end of this paper.},

  abstract = {Calibration and validation of aboveground biomass (AGB) (AGB) products retrieved from satellite-borne sensors require accurate AGB estimates across hectare scales (1 to 100 ha). Recent studies recommend making use of non-destructive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) based techniques for individual tree AGB estimation that provide unbiased AGB predictors. However, applying these techniques across large sites and landscapes remains logis\- tically challenging. Unoccupied aerial vehicle laser scanning (UAV-LS) has the potential to address this through the collection of high density point clouds across many hectares, but estimation of individual tree AGB based on these data has been challenging so far, especially in dense tropical canopies. In this study, we investigated how TLS and UAV-LS can be used for this purpose by testing different modelling strategies with data availability and modelling framework requirements. The study included data from four forested sites across three biomes: temperate, wet tropical, and tropical savanna. At each site, coincident TLS and UAV-LS campaigns were con\- ducted. Diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height were estimated from TLS point clouds. Individual tree AGB was estimated for {$\geq$}170 trees per site based on TLS tree point clouds and quantitative structure modelling (QSM), and treated as the best available, non-destructive estimate of AGB in the absence of direct, destructive measurements. Individual trees were automatically segmented from the UAV-LS point clouds using a shortestpath algorithm on the full 3D point cloud. Predictions were evaluated in terms of individual tree root mean square error (RMSE) and population bias, the latter being the absolute difference between total tree sample population TLS QSM estimated AGB and predicted AGB. The application of global allometric scaling models (ASM) at local scale and across data modalities, i.e., field-inventory and light detection and ranging LiDAR metrics, resulted in individual tree prediction errors in the range of reported studies, but relatively high popu\- lation bias. The use of adjustment factors should be considered to translate between data modalities. When calibrating local models, DBH was confirmed as a strong predictor of AGB, and useful when scaling AGB esti\- mates with field inventories. The combination of UAV-LS derived tree metrics with non-parametric modelling generally produced high individual tree RMSE, but very low population bias of {$\leq$}5\% across sites starting from 55 training samples. UAV-LS has the potential to scale AGB estimates across hectares with reduced fieldwork time.},

  abstract = {Vegetation phenology is considered an important biological indicator in understanding the behaviour of ecosystems and how it responds to environmental cues. Changes in vegetation dynamics have been strongly linked to the variability of climate patterns and may have an important impact on the ecological processes of ecosystems, such as the land surface-atmosphere exchange of water and carbon, energy flows and interaction between different species. Land surface phenology (LSP) is the study of seasonal patterns in plant phenophases based on time series from vegetation indices (VI) or biophysical variables derived from satellite data, and has played an essential role in monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes from local to global scales. The goal of this systematic literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of the main contributions of the global LSP research to the development of environmental knowledge and remote sensing science and technology, identifying possible gaps that could be addressed in the coming years. This systematic review found that the number of LSP studies has grown exponentially since the 1980s, although the analysis of phenological metrics or phenometrics derived from satellite data (i.e. proxies for the biological phenophases of plants) has focused specifically on ecosystems located in the mid- and high-altitude in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. boreal forest/taiga, evergreen, deciduous or mixed temperate forest). LSP studies use different satellite dataset and methods to estimate phenometrics. These studies identified an advance in spring and a delay in autumn phenophases as general trends. Although these trends were associated mainly to changes in temperature and precipitation, phenological cycle dynamics might be related to other drivers, such as photoperiod, soil moisture or organic carbon content, among others. Therefore, this interaction between different climatic and non-climatic drivers make phenology modelling a difficult task. Hence, in the coming years, a greater integration of LSP data into ecological process modelling could provide a more complete overview on the terrestrial ecosystems functioning. Furthermore, different technical and methodological aspects (e.g. greater temporal coverage of recent high-spatial-resolution satellites, advances in remote-sensing technology or improved efficiency in the computational processing of geospatial data) may also contribute to improve our understanding of Earth's ecosystem dynamics and their environmental drivers.},

  abstract = {The global challenge of understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses to climate extremes and climate change is addressed in this review of research enabled through environmental research infrastructure (RI) provided by Australia's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN). Two primary climatic drivers of ecosystem structure and function in Australia are fire and aridity, to which Australian flora and fauna have shown marked adaptability. Australian vegetation shows resilience to climate extremes of flooding rains, droughts and heatwaves such that variability in primary productivity of Australian vegetation has a tangible effect on the global carbon cycle. Nonetheless, Australian flora and ecosystems could be vulnerable to projected climate change (e.g. to increasing vapour pressure deficit). Refugia are also vulnerable to climate change, with conditions in these areas already near the tipping point for a change in community composition. Ensuring genetic diversity during directional change in climate (e.g. increasing aridity) requires proactive approaches to conservation and restoration projects. To address these challenges, TERN provides environmental RI at three scales of observation: (i) environmental monitoring using remote sensing techniques at a landscape and continental scale; (ii) a spatially extensive network of ecosystem monitoring plots; and (iii) intensely measured sites collecting detailed data on ecosystem processes. Through partnerships with international environmental RIs, TERN enables research that addresses global challenges, on the first steps toward the forecasting of ecosystem\textendash climate interactions.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of vegetation phenology has long been used to characterize ecosystem functions and responses to climate at spatial and temporal scales unfeasible to field surveys. However, the potential of remote sensing to elucidate mechanistic drivers of phenology and the underlying plant community processes at such scales remains under-discussed. This review synthesizes possibilities to advance this knowledge using multi-temporal remote sensing and discusses remaining challenges and progress in instruments and analytical tools. Recent evidence indicates that, besides documenting vegetation seasonality and responses to climate, remote sensing of phenology can help meet emerging needs for indicators of plant diversity, vegetation structure and ecosystem change. Responses of phenological metrics to stressors over large, heterogeneous regions may provide clues on ecological resilience manifested in asynchronies, recovery of vegetation cycles and stable microrefugia. At the same time, important barriers persist in relation to choosing among phenological estimation methods and paradigms, characterizing phenological events beyond changes in photosynthetically active biomass, and mechanistic interpretation of phenological patterns. Synthesis. Increasing temporal frequency of products, opportunities for multi-sensor data fusion, and advances in historically less available hyperspectral, active microwave and lidar instruments promise to help navigate these barriers and enable more comprehensive assessments of seasonality. Progress in customizable local platforms such as unoccupied aerial vehicles and phenocams may further enrich ground-level understanding of phenology and validate satellite-based assessments. However, remote sensing analyses alone are insufficient for mechanistic interpretation of phenology, which can be challenged by artefacts in remote sensing data and sensitivity of estimated metrics to landscape structure and spatial resolution of the inputs. Robust and informative phenological assessments call for rigorous collaborations with field ecological studies, strategic selection of ancillary environmental and geographic data, and wider adoption of causal inference approaches to address these needs and support novel explorations in plant ecology.},

Existing empirical and model-based satellite broadband spectra-based products have been shown to miss critical variation in GPP. Here, we evaluate the potential of high spectral resolution (10 nm) shortwave (400\textendash 2,500 nm) imagery to better detect spatial and temporal variations in GPP across a range of ecosystems, including forests, grassland-savannas, wetlands, and shrublands in a water-stressed region. Estimates of GPP from eddy covariance observations were compared against airborne hyperspectral imagery, collected across California during the 2013\textendash 2014 HyspIRI airborne preparatory campaign. Observations from 19 flux towers across 23 flight campaigns (102 total image-flux tower pairs) showed GPP to be strongly correlated to a suite of spectral wavelengths and band ratios associated with foliar physiology and chemistry. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling approach was then used to predict GPP with higher validation accuracy (adjusted R2 = 0.71) and low bias (0.04) compared to existing broadband approaches (e.g., adjusted R2 = 0.68 and bias = \`A5.71 with the Sims et al. [2008] model). Significant wavelengths contributing to the PLSR include those previously shown to coincide with Rubisco (wavelengths 1,680, 1,740, and 2,290 nm) and Vcmax (wavelengths 1,680, 1,722, 1,732, 1,760, and 2,300 nm).

  abstract = {Variability in spectral reflectance due to spatial and temporal gradients in vegetation phenology presents issues for accurate vegetation classification. Phenological variability through space and over time can result in misclassification when spectra from non-representative areas or times are used as training data. Vegetation classification at the species level could benefit from introducing phenological information to spectral libraries, but utilization of this information across multiple dates of imagery will require new approaches to building spectral libraries and to classification. This paper explores an automated method for selecting a single multi-temporal spectral library that can be used to classify vegetation species across multiple dates within an image time series. Iterative Endmember Selection (IES) was used to select spectra from Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired on five dates in the same year. IES selected spectra to maximize species classification accuracy (as measured by Kappa) within a multi-temporal spectral library that included spectra from all image dates. The resulting multi-temporal endmember library was applied using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to classify vegetation species and land cover across all five images. Results indicate that multi-temporal, seasonally-mixed spectral libraries achieved similar overall classification accuracy compared to single-date libraries, and in some cases, resulted in improved classification accuracy. Several species had increased Producer's or User's accuracy using a multi-temporal library, while others had reduced accuracy compared to same-date classifications. The image dates of endmembers used to map species in each image were examined to determine if this information could improve our understanding of phenological spectral differences for specific species. Multi-temporal endmember libraries could provide a means for mapping species in data where phenology, climatic variability, or spatial gradients are not known in advance or may not be easily accounted for by endmembers from a single date. New missions, such as the proposed Hysperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission, will provide greatly improved access to multi-temporal spectral datasets and new opportunities for mapping vegetation spectral variability on regional-to-global scales.},

Despite its importance, a robust, time, and cost-effective methodology to estimate variation in foliar N concentration across globally represented terrestrial systems does not exist. Although advances in remote sensing data have enabled landscape-scale foliar N predictions, improved accuracy is needed to effectively capture variation in foliar N across ecosystems. Airborne remote sensing imagery was analyzed in conjunction with ground-sampled foliar chemistry data (n = 692), provided by the NEON, to predict foliar N at sites across the United States covering a variety of plant communities and climate types. We developed indices from novel two-band combinations that predicted foliar N more accurately than existing indices ({$\approx$}8\% improvement across all sites and a 45\% improvement in arid sites). Compared with two-band indices, we increased accuracy and decreased bias of foliar N predictions by using full-spectrum reflectance information and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models (R2 = 0.638; root mean square error = 0.440). Significant wavelengths included red edge (720\textendash 765 nm), near infrared (NIR) reflectance at 1125 nm, and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance at 2050 and 2095 nm, which are regions indicative of foliar traits such as growth type (e.g., leaf area index with NIR) and photosynthetic parameters (e.g., chlorophyll and Rubisco with red and SWIR reflectance, respectively). With the confluence of rapid increases in computing power, several forthcoming or recently launched hyperspectral missions, and the development of large-scale environmental research observatories worldwide, we have an exciting opportunity to estimate foliar N across larger spatial areas covering more diverse biomes than ever before. We anticipate that these predictions will prove to be invaluable in helping to constrain biogeochemical model uncertainties across a global range of terrestrial ecosystems.},

We here develop an indicator addressing just one of many possible dimensions of ecosystem resilience, by focusing on the capacity of ecosystems to retain biological diversity in the face of ongoing, and uncertain, climate change. The Bioclimatic Ecosystem Resilience Index (BERI) assesses the extent to which a given spatial configuration of natural habitat will promote or hinder climate-induced shifts in biological distributions. The approach uses existing global modelling of spatial turnover in species composition within three broad biological groups (plants, invertebrates and vertebrates) to scale projected changes in composition under a plausible range of climate scenarios. These projections serve as filters through which to analyse the configuration of habitat observed at a given point in time (e.g. for a particular year) \textendash{} represented as a grid in which cells are scored in terms of habitat condition. BERI is then calculated, for each cell in this grid, as a function of the connectedness of that cell to areas of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape which are projected to support a similar composition of species under climate change to that currently associated with the focal cell. All analyses are performed at 30-arcsecond grid resolution (approximately 1~km cells at the equator). Results can then be aggregated to report on status and trends for any desired set of reporting units \textendash{} e.g. ecoregions, countries, or ecosystem types. We present example outputs for the Moist Tropical Forest Biome, based on a habitat-condition time series derived from the Global Forest Change dataset. We also describe how BERI is now being extended to cover all biomes (forest and non-forest) across the entire terrestrial surface of the planet.},

  abstract = {The collection of high-quality field measurements of ground cover is critical for calibration and validation of fractional ground cover maps derived from satellite imagery. Field-based hyperspectral ground cover sampling is a potential alternative to traditional in situ techniques. This study aimed to develop an effective sampling design for spectral ground cover surveys in order to estimate fractional ground cover in the Australian arid zone. To meet this aim, we addressed two key objectives: (1) Determining how spectral surveys and traditional step-point sampling compare when conducted at the same spatial scale and (2) comparing these two methods to current Australian satellite-derived fractional cover products. Across seven arid, sparsely vegetated survey sites, six 500-m transects were established. Ground cover reflectance was recorded taking continuous hyperspectral readings along each transect while step-point surveys were conducted along the same transects. Both measures of ground cover were converted into proportions of photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare soil for each site. Comparisons were made of the proportions of photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare soil derived from both in situ methods as well as MODIS and Landsat fractional cover products. We found strong correlations between fractional cover derived from hyperspectral and step-point sampling conducted at the same spatial scale at our survey sites. Comparison of the in situ measurements and image-derived fractional cover products showed that overall, the Landsat product was strongly related to both in situ methods for non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil whereas the MODIS product was strongly correlated with both in situ methods for photosynthetic vegetation. This study demonstrates the potential of the spectral transect method, both in its ability to produce results comparable to the traditional transect measures, but also in its improved objectivity and relative logistic ease. Future efforts should be made to include spectral ground cover sampling as part of Australia's plan to produce calibration and validation datasets for remotely sensed products.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed ground cover maps are routinely validated using field data collected by observers who classify ground cover into defined categories such as photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), bare soil (BS), and rock. There is an element of subjectivity to the classification of PV and NPV, and classifications may differ between observers. An alternative is to estimate ground cover based on in situ hyperspectral reflectance measurements (HRM). This study examines observer consistency when classifying vegetation samples of wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Gladius) covering the full range of photosynthetic activity, from completely senesced (0\% PV) to completely green (100\% PV), as photosynthetic or non-photosynthetic. We also examine how the classification of spectra of the same vegetation samples compares to the observer results. We collected HRM and photographs, over two months, to capture the transition of wheat leaves from 100\% PV to 100\% NPV. To simulate typical field methodology, observers viewed the photographs and classified each leaf as either PV or NPV, while spectral unmixing was used to decompose the HRM of the leaves into proportions of PV and NPV. The results showed that when a leaf was {$\leq$}25\% or {$\geq$}75\% PV observers tended to agree, and assign the leaf to the expected category. However, as leaves transitioned from PV to NPV (i.e., PV {$\geq$} 25\% but {$\leq$} 75\%) observers' decisions differed more widely and their classifications showed little agreement with the spectral proportions of PV and NPV. This has significant implications for the reliability of data collected using binary methods in areas containing a significant proportion of vegetation in this intermediate range such as the over/underestimation of PV and NPV vegetation and how reliably this data can then be used to validate remotely sensed products.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can provide accurate and detailed three-dimensional (3D) structure information of the forest understory. Segmenting individual trees from disordered, discrete, and high-density TLS point clouds is the premise for obtaining accurate individual tree structure parameters of forest understory, pest control and fine modeling. In this study, we propose a bottom-up method to segment individual trees from TLS forest data based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). In addition, we also improve the DBSCAN based on the distance distribution matrix (DDM) to automatically and adaptively determine the optimal cluster number and the corresponding input parameters. Firstly, the proposed method is based on the improved DBSCAN to detect the trunks and obtain the initial clustering results. Then, the Hough circle fitting method is used to modify the trunk detection results. Finally, individual tree segmentation is realized based on regional growth layer-by-layer clustering. In this paper, we use TLS multi-station scanning data from Chinese artificial forest and German mixed forest, and then evaluate the efficiency of the method from three aspects: overall segmentation, trunk detection and small tree segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared with three existing individual tree segmentation methods. The results show that the total recall, precision, and F1-score of the proposed method are 90.84\%, 95.38\% and 0.93, respectively. Compared with traditional DBSCAN, recall, accuracy and F1-score are increased by 6.96\%, 4.14\% and 0.06, respectively. The individual tree segmentation result of the proposed method is comparable to those of the existing methods, and the optimal parameters can be automatically extracted and the small trees under tall trees can be accurately segmented.},

  abstract = {Lespedeza cuneata (sericea lespedeza; hereafter ``sericea'') is an invasive species brought to the U.S. from East Asia in the 1890s to be used as forage. However, it has now become a growing ecological and economic threat in grasslands of several states in the U.S. southern Great Plains including Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. Here, we demonstrate the capability of airborne imaging spectroscopy to map sericea in a large natural grassland within the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, the largest protected tallgrass prairie in the world, located in northeastern Oklahoma. Through this research, we investigated which remotely observable vegetation functional traits (referring to biochemical, physiological, and structural traits) contribute to distinguishing sericea from cooccurring native species and whether we can detect sericea remotely through quantifying these functional traits using imaging spectroscopic data (also known as hyperspectral data). To achieve these objectives, full-range airborne hyperspectral data with spatial resolution of 1 m were collected from the study area in August 2020. In addition, a total of 12 vegetation functional traits were measured through field sampling for model devel\- opment. We first identified functional traits that contributed to separating sericea from other species, and then used them in a classification model to detect sericea in our study site. We found total carotenoids (sum of neoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein), chlorophyll a + b (sum of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b), total nitrogen, canopy height, potassium, and magnesium as the main functional traits contrib\- uting to the detection of sericea; an overall classification accuracy of approximately 94\% was reported. However, the proposed approach overestimated sericea cover in species-rich plant communities. Overall, our findings demonstrated an essential role for airborne remote sensing in 1) direct mapping of invasive plants and 2) quantifying functional traits associated with success strategies of invasive species. Eventually, experiments like ours can aid in developing large-scale and science-driven management practices to both identify the current extent, and to control the spread of invasive species in grasslands and similar short-stature environments. This will not only improve management practices but will have major societal and economic benefits.},

Commercial growers rely entirely on seed producers and certification systems to get disease-free seed as they have no recourse to mitigate seed-borne PVY after the seed is planted. Potato seed stock producers currently utilize intensive pesticide applications to suppress insect vectors and human-resource intensive activities where workers visually inspect and remove suspect infected plants during the growing season. Industry stakeholders also depend upon extensive field and tuber sampling coupled with off-season growouts and laboratory testing to ascertain infection levels within certification programs. Despite these efforts, seed producers and certification agencies are currently unable to control PVY infection in the industry's seed pipeline, and this has a significant impact on commercial markets and regional economies. The industry also lacks a consistent, scalable, accurate, and robust detection system capable of assessing every plant within the seed potato production agro-ecosystem during the production season. Remote sensing technologies coupled with machine learning classifiers are a significant leap forward in the detection and differentiation of plant disease incidence. The continuing advancement of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and unmanned ground vehicles provide access to high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution instrumentation with which to monitor dynamic agricultural production systems at a leaf-scale resolution. In this study, we demonstrate PVY-infected potato plants in an agricultural production field produce different spectral reflectance profiles in comparison to neighboring non-infected plants. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier differentiated spectral reflectance curves of PVY-infected and noninfected plants at an accuracy of 89.8\% using near infrared and shortwave infrared wavelengths. The classification accuracy dropped to 46.9\% using red, green, and blue wavelengths that the industry currently utilizes to detect diseased plants visually. This research shows that remote sensing and machine learning classifiers outperform current industry standards and have the potential to greatly enhance PVY detection efforts resulting in improved potato seed stock quality necessary to maximize yields.},

  abstract = {With an increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires across the globe and resultant changes to long-established fire regimes, the mapping of fire severity is a vital part of monitoring ecosystem resilience and recovery. The emergence of unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) and compact sensors (RGB and LiDAR) provide new opportunities to map fire severity. This paper conducts a comparison of metrics derived from UAS Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds and UAS image based products to classify fire severity. A workflow which derives novel metrics describing vegetation structure and fire severity from UAS remote sensing data is developed that fully utilises the vegetation information available in both data sources. UAS imagery and LiDAR data were captured pre- and post-fire over a 300 m by 300 m study area in Tasmania, Australia. The study area featured a vegetation gradient from sedgeland vegetation (e.g., button grass 0.2 m) to forest (e.g., Eucalyptus obliqua and Eucalyptus globulus 50 m). To classify the vegetation and fire severity, a comprehensive set of variables describing structural, textural and spectral characteristics were gathered using UAS images and UAS LiDAR datasets. A recursive feature elimination process was used to highlight the subsets of variables to be included in random forest classifiers. The classifier was then used to map vegetation and severity across the study area. The results indicate that UAS LiDAR provided similar overall accuracy to UAS image and combined (UAS LiDAR and UAS image predictor values) data streams to classify vegetation (UAS image: 80.6\%; UAS LiDAR: 78.9\%; and Combined: 83.1\%) and severity in areas of forest (UAS image: 76.6\%, UAS LiDAR: 74.5\%; and Combined: 78.5\%) and areas of sedgeland (UAS image: 72.4\%; UAS LiDAR: 75.2\%; and Combined: 76.6\%). These results indicate that UAS SfM and LiDAR point clouds can be used to assess fire severity at very high spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Grasslands and savannas form a heterogeneous and patchy mosaic of spectral properties that are challenging for characterization of vegetation states. This study examines the potential for use of suites of vegetation indices (VIs) from the proposed Sentinel 2 sensor to describe vegetation states in grasslands and savannas for a North American transect. Hyperion hyperspectral data from the EO-1 satellite were used to simulate Sentinel 2, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) images for field sites in Alberta, North Dakota and Texas that represent the continuum from short grass prairie to oak savanna and are intermingled with agriculture. Indices representing photosynthetic pigments (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Carotenoid Reflectance Index, Anthocyanin Reflectance Index and Red-Green Ratio), vegetation and landscape water content (Normalized Difference Infrared Index), senescent vegetation and soil (Short Wave Infrared Ratio and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index) and herbaceous biomass (Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) were used. There were distinct differences among sites in the relative sensitivity of different VIs depending upon moisture status, tree cover and type of grassland. Simple multi-variate models based on mean values of VIs showed limited ability to predict land cover classes and nominal vegetation states. However, analysis of sample areas using pixels as individual observations within a statistical distribution indicated that subtle variation and gradients within management or land units could be used to characterize fine differences in selected nominal states at each site. Despite some differences in band locations, all VIs except the anthocyanin reflectance index were scalable between Sentinel 2 and MODIS and VIIRS data. A framework for using suites of VIs as indicators of vegetation states that could be applied to the state and transition model approach applied by the US Natural Resource Conservation Service is described. Land types can be effectively characterized by pixel value distribution histograms, and statistical metrics may be used as indicators of status and change. However, time series are needed to fully capture states and state changes, since grasslands and savannas have such high levels of spectral and phenological variation.},

  abstract = {Increased urbanization means human beings become the dominant species and reduction in canopy cover. Globally, urban trees grow under challenging and complex circumstances with urbanization trends of increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, high temperature and drought stress. This study aims to provide a better understanding of urban trees' morpho-physio-biochemical attributes that can support sustainable urban greening programs and urban climate change mitigation policies. Globally, urban dwellers' population is on the rise and spreading to suburban areas over time with an increase in domestic CO2 emissions. Uncertainty and less information on urban tree diversification and resistance to abiotic stress may create deterioration of ecosystem resilience over time. This review uses general parameters for urban tree physiology studies and employs three approaches for evaluating ecosystem resilience based on urban stress resistance in relation to trees' morphological, physiological and biochemical attributes. Due to the lack of a research model of ecosystem resilience and urban stress resistance of trees, this review demonstrates that the model concept supports future urban tree physiology research needs. In particular, it is necessary to develop integral methodologies and an urban tree research concept to assess how main and combined effects of drought and/or climate changes affect indigenous and exotic trees that are commonly grown in cities.},

  abstract = {Identifying and characterizing vascular plants in time and space is required in various disciplines, e.g. in forestry, conservation and agriculture. Remote sensing emerged as a key technology revealing both spatial and temporal vegetation patterns. Harnessing the ever growing streams of remote sensing data for the increasing demands on vegetation assessments and monitoring requires efficient, accurate and flexible methods for data analysis. In this respect, the use of deep learning methods is trend-setting, enabling high predictive accuracy, while learning the relevant data features independently in an end-to-end fashion. Very recently, a series of studies have demon\- strated that the deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is very effective to represent spatial patterns enabling to extract a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing imagery. This review introduces the principles of CNN and distils why they are particularly suitable for vegetation remote sensing. The main part synthesizes current trends and developments, including considerations about spectral resolution, spatial grain, different sensors types, modes of reference data generation, sources of existing reference data, as well as CNN approaches and architectures. The literature review showed that CNN can be applied to various problems, including the detection of individual plants or the pixel-wise segmentation of vegetation classes, while numerous studies have evinced that CNN outperform shallow machine learning methods. Several studies suggest that the ability of CNN to exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high spatial resolution data. The modularity in the common deep learning frameworks allows a high flexibility for the adaptation of architectures, whereby especially multi-modal or multi-temporal applications can benefit. An increasing availability of techniques for visualizing features learned by CNNs will not only contribute to interpret but to learn from such models and improve our understanding of remotely sensed signals of vegetation. Although CNN has not been around for long, it seems obvious that they will usher in a new era of vegetation remote sensing.},

Multispectral remote sensing applications from UAS are reported in the literature less commonly than applications using visible bands, although light-weight multispectral sensors for UAS are being used increasingly. . In this paper, we describe challenges and solutions associated with efficient processing of multispectral imagery to obtain orthorectified, radiometrically calibrated image mosaics for the purpose of rangeland vegetation classification. We developed automated batch processing methods for file conversion, band-to-band registration, radiometric correction, and orthorectification. An object-based image analysis approach was used to derive a species-level vegetation classification for the image mosaic with an overall accuracy of 87\%. We obtained good correlations between: (1) ground and airborne spectral reflectance (R2 = 0.92); and (2) spectral reflectance derived from airborne and WorldView-2 satellite data for selected vegetation and soil targets. UAS-acquired multispectral imagery provides quality high resolution information for rangeland applications with the potential for upscaling the data to larger areas using high resolution satellite imagery.},

Our goal is to assess the influence of physical disturbance for ecosystem functioning in coastal sand dunes. We set up an experimental design, including two treatments in four blocks, in a four km-long dune site from South West France. We simulated physical disturbance from marine and wind origin, digging Experimental Notches (EN), in the incipient (West EN treatment) and established foredunes (East EN treatment), respectively and compared the effects of EN to controls along transects including 13 positions from the beach to the transition dune behind ENs. We sampled litter decomposition rate, elevation variation, wind abrasion, sand grain size and vegetation composition. We also used drones to quantify sand deposition sheets during severe winter storms. Litter decomposition rate was the highest where sand accumulated the most, at the ecotone between the established foredune and transition dune and in the East EN treatment. This increase of ecosystem functioning was correlated to wind patterns. However, there was also a strong alongshore variability, with important sand deposition sheets occurring in some blocks depending on dune geomorphology. Vegetation composition was mainly influenced by shoreline distance, but also by the block and EN treatment, with a strong interaction between these three effects. We conclude that physical disturbance increase ecosystem functioning in the stressful conditions of the Atlantic sand dunes, only when sand accumulates, whereas excessive disturbances enhancing sand erosion are not favorable for ecosystem functioning.},

Mats near Howard Glacier and Canada Glacier (ASPA 131) were mapped and mat samples were collected for DNA-based microbiome analysis. Although a broadband spectral parameter (a partial normalized difference vegetation index) identified mats, it missed mats in comparatively deep ({$>$} 10 cm) water or on bouldery surfaces where mats occupied fringing moats. A hyperspectral parameter (B6) did not have these shortcomings and recorded a larger dynamic range at both sites. When linked with colour orthomosaic data, B6 band strength is shown to be capable of characterizing the presence, type and activity of cyanobacteria-dominated mats in and around MDV streams. 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction amplicon sequencing analysis of the mat samples revealed that dominant cyanobacterial taxa differed between spectrally distinguishable mats, indicating that spectral differences reflect underlying biological distinctiveness. Combined rapid-repeat hyperspectral measurements can be applied in order to monitor the distribution and activity of sentinel microbial ecosystems across the terrestrial Antarctic.},

Efficient and non-destructive hyperspectral imaging can quantify plant physiological traits under abiotic stresses; however, prediction models generally are developed for few genotypes of one species, limiting the broader applications of this technology. Therefore, the objective of this research was to explore the possibility of developing cross-species models to predict physiological traits (relative water content and nitrogen content) based on hyperspectral reflectance through partial least square regression for three genotypes of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and six genotypes of corn (Zea mays L.) under varying water and nitrogen treatments. Multi-species models were predictive for the relative water content of sorghum and corn (R2 = 0.809), as well as for the nitrogen content of sorghum and corn (R2 = 0.637). Reflectances at 506, 535, 583, 627, 652, 694, 722, and 964 nm were responsive to changes in the relative water content, while the reflectances at 486, 521, 625, 680, 699, and 754 nm were responsive to changes in the nitrogen content. High-throughput hyperspectral imaging can be used to predict physiological status of plants across genotypes and some similar species with acceptable accuracy.},

By using regression and pixel dichotomy models, we present the comparison of Sentinel-2A (S2) multispectral instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 (L8) operational land imager (OLI) data regarding the retrieval of FVC in a semi-arid sandy area (Mu Us Sandland, China, in August 2016). A combination of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) high-spatial-resolution images and field plots were used to produce verified data. Based on a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) regression model, the results showed that, compared with that of L8, the coefficient of determination (R2) of S2 increased by 26.0\%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) and the sum of absolute error (SAE) decreased by 3.0\% and 11.4\%, respectively. For the ratio vegetation index (RVI) regression model, compared with that of L8, the R2 of S2 increased by 26.0\%, and the RMSE and SAE decreased by 8.0\% and 20.0\%, respectively. When the pixel dichotomy model was used, compared with that of L8, the RMSE of S2 decreased by 21.3\%, and the SAE decreased by 26.9\%. Overall, S2 performed better than L8 in terms of FVC inversion. Additionally, in this paper, we develop a verified scheme based on UAV data in combination with the object-based classification method. This scheme is feasible and sufficiently robust for building relationships between field data and inversion results from satellite data. Further, the synergy of multi-source sensors (especially UAVs and satellites) is a potential effective way to estimate and evaluate regional ecological environmental parameters (FVC).},

We conducted monthly flights using a Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) in 2017 and 2018 over a 10-ha deferred grazing rangeland. Daily maps of NDVI at 30-cm resolution were first derived by fusing monthly 30-cm sUAS imagery and more frequent 3-m PlanetScope satellite observations. We estimated aboveground net primary production as a product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) derived from NDVI and light use efficiency (LUE), optimized as a function of topography and climate stressors. The estimated forage production agreed well with field measurements having a R2 of 0.80 and RMSE of 542 kg/ha. Cumulative NDVI and APAR were less correlated with measured biomass (R2 = 0.68). Daily forage production maps captured similar seasonal and spatial patterns compared to field-based biomass measurements. Our study demonstrated the utility of aerial and satellite remote sensing technology in supporting adaptive rangeland management, especially during an era of climatic extremes, by providing spatially explicit and near-real-time forage production estimates.},

Structure from Motion (SfM) computer vision techniques were applied to derive ultra-high resolution 3D models from multi-view aerial photography. A 2cm~digital surface model (DSM) and 1cm~orthophoto mosaic were derived from the 3D model and aerial photographs, respectively. The geometric accuracy of the orthophoto and DSM was 4cm. A weighted contributing upstream area was derived with the D-infinity algorithm, based on the DSM and a snow cover map derived from the orthophoto. The contributing upstream area was used as a proxy for water availability from snowmelt, one of the key environmental drivers of moss health. A Monte Carlo simulation with 300 realisations was implemented to model the impact of error in the DSM on runoff direction. Significant correlations were found between these simulated water availability values and field measurements of moss health and water content. In the future ultra-high spatial resolution DSMs acquired with a UAV could thus be used to determine the impact of changing snow cover on the health and spatial distribution of polar vegetation non-destructively.},

Recent large-scale drought and flooding over numerous continents provide unique opportunities to understand ecosystem responses to climatic extremes. In this study, we investigated the impacts of the early 21st century extreme hydroclimatic variations in southeastern Australia on phenology and vegetation productivity using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Enhanced Vegetation Index and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index. Results revealed dramatic impacts of drought and wet extremes on vegetation dynamics, with abrupt between year changes in phenology. Drought resulted in widespread reductions or collapse in the normal patterns of seasonality such that in many cases there was no detectable phenological cycle during drought years. Across the full range of biomes examined, we found semiarid ecosystems to exhibit the largest sensitivity to hydroclimatic variations, exceeding that of arid and humid ecosystems. This result demonstrated the vulnerability of semiarid ecosystems to climatic extremes and potential loss of ecosystem resilience with future mega-drought events. A skewed distribution of hydroclimatic sensitivity with aridity is of global biogeochemical significance because it suggests that current drying trends in semiarid regions will reduce hydroclimatic sensitivity and suppress the large carbon sink that has been reported during recent wet periods (e.g., 2011 La Ni\~na).},

  abstract = {The rapid anthropogenic climate change that is being experienced in the early twenty-first century is intimately entwined with the health and functioning of the biosphere. Climate change is impacting ecosystems through changes in mean conditions and in climate variability, coupled with other associated changes such as increased ocean acidification and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. It also interacts with other pressures on ecosystems, including degradation, defaunation and fragmentation. There is a need to understand the ecological dynamics of these climate impacts, to identify hotspots of vulnerability and resilience and to identify management interventions that may assist biosphere resilience to climate change. At the same time, ecosystems can also assist in the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. The mechanisms, potential and limits of such nature-based solutions to climate change need to be explored and quantified. This paper introduces a thematic issue dedicated to the interaction between climate change and the biosphere. It explores novel perspectives on how ecosystems respond to climate change, how ecosystem resilience can be enhanced and how ecosystems can assist in addressing the challenge of a changing climate. It draws on a Royal Society-National Academy of Sciences Forum held in Washington DC in November 2018, where these themes and issues were discussed. We conclude by identifying some priorities for academic research and practical implementation, in order to maximize the potential for maintaining a diverse, resilient and well-functioning biosphere under the challenging conditions of the twenty-first century.

Data was collected using the 20 band hyperspectral snapshot PhotonFocus sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. The spectral range of the sensor is 600 to 875 nm. Four vegetation classes were identified for analysis including Themeda triandra grassland, Wilsonia rotundifolia, Danthonia/Poa grassland, and Acacia dealbata. In addition to the hyperspectral UAS dataset, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) was derived using a structure-from-motion (SfM). Classification was undertaken using an object-based Random Forest (RF) classification model. Variable importance measures from the training model indicated that the DSM was the most significant variable. Key spectral variables included bands two (620.9 nm), four (651.1 nm), and 11 (763.2 nm) from the hyperspectral UAS imagery. Classification validation was performed using both the reference segments and the two transects. For the reference object validation, mean accuracies were between 70\% and 72\%. Classification accuracies based on the validation transects achieved a maximum overall classification accuracy of 93.},

  abstract = {Conventional methods to access plant physiological traits are based on destructive measurements by means of biochemical extraction or leaf clipping, thereby limiting the throughput capability. With advances in hyper\- spectral imaging sensor, fast, non-invasive and non-destructive measurements of a plant's physiological status became feasible. In this work, a non-destructive method for the characterization of a plant's status from hyperspectral images is presented. A supervised data-driven method based on Machine Learning Regression (MLR) algorithms was developed to generate prediction models of four targeted physiological traits: water po\- tential, effective quantum yield of photosystem II, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance. Standard Normal Variate (SNV) transformed reflectance spectra were used as the input variables for building the regression model. Three MLR algorithms: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) were explored as candidate methods for building the prediction model of the targeted physiological traits. Validation results show that the non-linear prediction models, developed based on the GPR algorithm produced the best estimation accuracy on all plant traits. The best prediction models were applied to a small-scale phenotyping experiment to study drought stress responses in maize plants. Results show that all estimated traits revealed a significant difference between plants under drought stress and normal growth dy\- namics as early as after 3 days of drought induction.},

  abstract = {Ephemeral rivers in arid regions act as linear oases, where corridors of vegetation supported by accessible groundwater and intermittent surface flows provide biological refugia in water-limited landscapes. The ecological and hydrological dynamics of these systems are poorly understood compared to perennial systems and subject to wide variation over space and time. This study used imagery obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enhance satellite data, which were then used to quantify change in woody vegetation cover along the ephemeral Kuiseb River in the Namib Desert over a 35-year period. Ultra-high resolution UAV imagery collected in 2016 was used to derive a model of fractional vegetation cover from five spectral vegetation indices, calculated from a contemporaneous Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provided the linear best-fit relationship for calculating fractional cover; the model derived from the two 2016 datasets was subsequently applied to 24 intercalibrated Landsat images to calculate fractional vegetation cover for the Kuiseb extending back to 1984. Overall vegetation cover increased by 33\% between 1984 and 2019, with the most highly vegetated reach of the river exhibiting the greatest positive change. This reach corresponds with the terminal alluvial zone, where most flood deposition occurs. The spatial and temporal trends discovered highlight the need for long-term monitoring of ephemeral ecosystems and demonstrate the efficacy of a multi-sensor approach to time series analysis using a UAV platform.},

The variety of UASs applications is immense, and so are the procedures to process UASs data described in the literature. Optimizing the workflow is still a matter of discussion. Here, we present a comprehensive synthesis aiming to identify common rules that shape workflows applied in UAS-based studies facing complexity in ecosystems. Analysing the studies, we found similarities irrespective of the ecosystem, according to the character of the property addressed, such as species composition (biodiversity), ecosystem structure (stand volume/complexity), plant status (phenology and stress levels), and dynamics (disturbances and regeneration). We propose a general framework allowing to design UAS-based vegetation surveys according to its purpose and the component of ecosystem complexity addressed. We support the framework by detailed schemes as well as examples of best practices of UAS studies covering each of the vegetation properties (i.e. composition, structure, status and dynamics) and related applications. For an efficient UAS survey, the following points are crucial: knowledge of the phenomenon, choice of platform, sensor, resolution (temporal, spatial and spectral), model and classification algorithm according to the phenomenon, as well as careful interpretation of the results. The simpler the procedure, the more robust, repeatable, applicable and cost effective it is. Therefore, the proper design can minimize the efforts while maximizing the quality of the results.},

  abstract = {Vegetation in semi-arid regions is often a spatially heteroge\- neous mix of bare soil, herbaceous vegetation, and woody plants. Detecting the fractional cover of woody plants versus herbaceous vegetation, in addition to non-photosynthetically active cover types such as biological soil crusts, dry grasses, and bare ground, is crucial for understanding spatial patterns and temporal changes in semi-arid savanna ecosystems. With and without the inclusion of LiDAR-derived canopy height infor\- mation, we tested different configurations of unsupervised lin\- ear unmixing classification of hyperspectral data to estimate fractional cover of tall woody plants, herbaceous vegetation, and other non-photosynthetically active cover types. To perform this analysis, we used 1 m resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR data collected by the NEON airborne observation platform at the Santa Rita Experimental Range in Arizona. Our results show that both hyperspectral and canopy height information are needed in the linear unmixing algorithm to correctly identify tall woody plants versus herbaceous vegetation. However, including height data is not always sufficient to be able to separate the two vegetation types: selecting the optimum num\- ber of endmembers is also crucial for separating these two types of photosynthetically active vegetation. In comparison to our reference dataset, fractional cover accuracy was highest for the woody plant class based on two accuracy assessment meth\- ods, although the fractional cover of dense woody plant is likely underestimated because linear unmixing also detects subcanopy elements. The accuracy of the herbaceous vegetation class was lower than the other classes, likely because of the presence of both active and senesced grasses. Our study pre\- sents the first use of both hyperspectral and canopy height information to separately detect fractional cover of woody plants versus herbaceous vegetation in addition to other bare soil cover types that should be useful for fractional cover classi\- fication in other semi-arid savanna ecosystems where hyper\- spectral and LiDAR data are available.},

  abstract = {The fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR) is an essential climate variable for assessing the productivity of ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing provides spatially distributed FAPAR products, but their accurate and efficient validation is challenging in forest environments. As the FAPAR is linked to the canopy structure, it may be approximated by the fractional vegetation cover (FCOVER) under the assumption that incoming radiation is either absorbed or passed through gaps in the canopy. With FCOVER being easier to retrieve, FAPAR validation activities could benefit from a priori information on FCOVER. Spatially distributed FCOVER is available from satellite remote sensing or can be retrieved from imagery of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) at a centimetric resolution. We investigated remote sensing-derived FCOVER as a proxy for in situ FAPAR in a dense mixed-coniferous forest, considering both absolute values and spatiotemporal variability. Therefore, direct FAPAR measurements, acquired with a Wireless Sensor Network, were related to FCOVER derived from UAV and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery at different seasons. The results indicated that spatially aggregated UAV-derived FCOVER was close (RMSE = 0.02) to in situ FAPAR during the peak vegetation period when the canopy was almost closed. The S2 FCOVER product underestimated both the in situ FAPAR and UAV-derived FCOVER (RMSE {$>$} 0.3), which we attributed to the generic nature of the retrieval algorithm and the coarser resolution of the product. We concluded that UAV-derived FCOVER may be used as a proxy for direct FAPAR measurements in dense canopies. As another key finding, the spatial variability of the FCOVER consistently surpassed that of the in situ FAPAR, which was also well-reflected in the S2 FAPAR and FCOVER products. We recommend integrating this experimental finding as consistency criteria in the context of ECV quality assessments. To facilitate the FAPAR sampling activities, we further suggest assessing the spatial variability of UAV-derived FCOVER to benchmark sampling sizes for in situ FAPAR measurements. Finally, our study contributes to refining the FAPAR sampling protocols needed for the validation and improvement of FAPAR estimates in forest environments.},

  abstract = {Forest vegetation classification and structure measurements are fundamental steps for planning, monitoring, and evaluating large-scale forest changes including restoration treatments. High spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing data are critically needed to classify vegetation and measure their 3-dimensional (3D) canopy structure at the level of individual species. Here we test high-resolution lidar, hyperspectral, and multispectral data collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and demonstrate a lidar-hyperspectral image fusion method in treated and control forests with varying tree density and canopy cover as well as in an ecotone environment to represent a gradient of vegetation and topography in northern Arizona, U.S.A. The fusion performs better (88\% overall accuracy) than either data type alone, particularly for species with similar spectral signatures, but different canopy sizes. The lidar data provides estimates of individual tree height (R2=0.90; RMSE=2.3m) and crown diameter (R2=0.72; RMSE=0.71m) as well as total tree canopy cover (R2=0.87; RMSE=9.5\%) and tree density (R2=0.77; RMSE=0.69 trees/cell) in 10m cells across thin only, burn only, thin-and-burn, and control treatments, where tree cover and density ranged between 22 and 50\% and 1\textendash 3.5 trees/cell, respectively. The lidar data also produces highly accurate digital elevation model (DEM) (R2=0.92; RMSE=0.75m). In comparison, 3D data derived from the multispectral data via structure-from-motion produced lower correlations with field-measured variables, especially in dense and structurally complex forests. The lidar, hyperspectral, and multispectral sensors, and the methods demonstrated here can be widely applied across a gradient of vegetation and topography for monitoring landscapes undergoing large-scale changes such as the forests in the southwestern U.S.A.},

It provides a new method and opportunity for plant ecologists to study issues from individual to regional scales. However, as a new method, UAVs remote sensing applications in plant ecology are still challenged. The needs of plant ecology research and the application development of UAVs remote sensing should be better integrated.This report provides a comprehensive review of UAV-based remote sensing applications in plant ecology to synthesize prospects of applying drones to advance plant ecology research.Of the 400 references, 59\% were published in remote sensing journals rather than in plant ecology journals, reflecting a substantial gap between the interests of remote sensing experts and plant ecologists. Most of the studies focused on UAV remote sensing's technical aspects, such as data processing and remote sensing inversion, with little attention on answering ecological questions. There were 61\% of studies involved community-scale research. RGB and multispectral cameras were the most used sensors (75\%). More ecologically meaningful parameters can be extracted from UAV data to better understand the canopy surface irregularity and community heterogeneity, identify geometrical characteristics of canopy gaps and construct canopy chemical assemblies from living vegetation volumes. More cooperation between plant ecologists and remote sensing experts is needed to promote UAV remote sensing in advancing plant ecology research.},

  abstract = {Aims Ecological restoration is integral to meeting conservation goals in rapidly changing landscapes, but outcomes vary substantially with some projects failing to meet their targets. To understand the causes of this variability, long-term monitoring of existing projects is critical, but this comes at considerable costs. Current literature counts several studies using time series of satellite images to assess vegetation responses to disturbances and landscape transformations. Yet such methods are seldom used in the restoration literature and in practice. This synthesis seeks to identify how common remote sensing approaches for the assessment of plant recovery could inform the monitoring and management of restored plant communities. Methods This paper reviews the methods and metrics used to detect trajectories (i.e., change through time) in plant properties from rich time series of aerial and satellite images following change drivers including fire, extreme climatic events, climate change, and pest outbreaks. Specifically, it reviews the sensors, vegetation properties, modeling approaches, and indicators that can help measure plant stress and response to interventions. Results and Conclusions Remote sensing methods commonly used in disturbance ecology and assessments of land-cover changes could inform the monitoring of restoration projects at low cost and over large spatio-temporal scales, thus bridging the gap between field surveys to rapidly identify stressors or unexpected vegetation responses. Potential applications include comparing sites to identify factors impacting their responses to restoration, assessing restoration success, and testing ecological hypotheses to guide future project planning and design.},

  abstract = {Land conversion and fragmentation threaten the resilience and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems which makes the future of their services to humans uncertain. Remote sensing can provide frequent and consistent data to facilitate wetland monitoring from regional to national scales and support their conservation and adaptive management. However, unique characteristics of wetlands, particularly land cover heterogeneity and background reflectance from soil, water and dead biomass, limit the efficacy of remote-sensing based metrics developed for terrestrial ecosystems. To identify the factors impacting satellite-based measurements of wetland greenness, we tested how six spectral vegetation indices responded to the land surface characteristics and regional climatic and edaphic context of 1,138 wetlands sites surveyed by the U.S EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were estimated using all cloud-free surface reflectance data captured in 2011 by Landsat 5~TM and 7 ETM+. We tested two annually aggregated metrics \textemdash maximum and median greenness\textemdash{} for each SVI to facilitate the analysis of such a large dataset of satellite images. Using univariate and multivariate ordinary least square regression, we assessed how the annual maximum and median of each SVI responded to indicators of vegetation structure and composition, presence of dead biomass, open water, bare soil, and climatic/edaphic variables. Results show that, in the full national-scale dataset, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) were most responsive to field-based metrics of vegetation structure and composition. However, the responses of SVIs differed significantly among wetland types, suggesting that their use should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the monitored wetlands. Annually aggregated metrics showed different sensitivity in multivariate models, with median greenness being more sensitive to structure and composition, but also to confounding site variables including litter, open water, and bare soil. This study represents a first-time effort to study relationships between the on-site properties of wetlands and their spectral characteristics at a national scale.},

Here, we provide an assessment of large-scale patterns of community-level nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in different plant tissues and then examine how nutrient allocations are coupled with plant productivity. The results show that nutrient concentrations in leaves are less responsive to abiotic environments than those in woody stems and roots (stable leaf nutrient concentration hypothesis); the relationships between vegetation primary productivity and leaf nutrient contents are stronger when less nutrients are allocated to the woody tissues (productivity\textendash nutrient allocation hypothesis) and are stronger in deciduous than in evergreen vegetation (productivity\textendash leaf lifespan hypothesis).           ,                             Plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content regulate productivity and carbon (C) sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. Estimates of the allocation of N and P content in plant tissues and the relationship between nutrient content and photosynthetic capacity are critical to predicting future ecosystem C sequestration under global change. In this study, by investigating the nutrient concentrations of plant leaves, stems, and roots across China's terrestrial biomes, we document large-scale patterns of community-level concentrations of C, N, and P. We also examine the possible correlation between nutrient content and plant production as indicated by vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). The nationally averaged community concentrations of C, N, and P were 436.8, 14.14, and 1.11 mg{$\cdot$}g               -1               for leaves; 448.3, 3.04 and 0.31 mg{$\cdot$}g               -1               for stems; and 418.2, 4.85, and 0.47 mg{$\cdot$}g               -1               for roots, respectively.

The N and P concentrations in stems and roots were generally more sensitive to the abiotic environment than those in leaves. There were strong power-law relationships between N (or P) content in different tissues for all biomes, which were closely coupled with vegetation GPP. These findings not only provide key parameters to develop empirical models to scale the responses of plants to global change from a single tissue to the whole community but also offer large-scale evidence of biome-dependent regulation of C sequestration by nutrients.},

Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and risks unacceptable environmental consequences. Global biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, to better identify high priority areas for conservation and to help maintain essential ecosystem goods and services. Traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral information content. However, questions regarding the complex drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of spectral diversity \textendash{} biodiversity relationship confound diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be better understood before these methods can be operationally applied. To address some of these topics, we (1) review the history of remote sensing approaches in biodiversity estimation, summarizing the pros and cons of different methods, (2) illustrate successes and major gaps of remote sensing of biodiversity, and (3) identify promising future directions. We focus on emerging methods using spectral diversity (optical diversity) as a proxy for terrestrial plant diversity that offer to revolutionize the study of diversity in its different dimensions (phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity) from remote sensing. We also discuss remaining knowledge gaps and ways spectral diversity might be effectively integrated into a global biodiversity monitoring system, bridging a gap between ecology and remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key variable to determine soil functioning, ecosystem services, and global carbon cycles. Spectroscopy, particularly optical hyperspectral reflectance coupled with machine learning, can provide rapid, efficient, and cost-effective quantification of SOC. However, how to exploit soil hyperspectral reflectance to predict SOC concentration, and the potential performance of airborne and satellite data for predicting surface SOC at large scales remain relatively underknown. This study utilized a continental-scale soil laboratory spectral library (37,540 full-pedon 350\textendash 2500 nm reflectance spectra with SOC concentration of 0\textendash 780 g{$\cdot$}kg- 1 across the US) to thoroughly evaluate seven machine learning algorithms including Partial-Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolu\- tional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) along with four preprocessed spectra, i.e. original, vector normalization, continuum removal, and first-order derivative, to quantify SOC concentration. Furthermore, by using the coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere radiative transfer model, we simulated twelve airborne and spaceborne hyper/multi-spectral remote sensing data from surface bare soil laboratory spectra to evaluate their potential for estimating SOC concentration of surface bare soils. Results show that LSTM achieved best predictive performance of quantifying SOC concentration for the whole data sets (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 30.81 g{$\cdot$}kg- 1), mineral soils (SOC {$\leq$} 120 g{$\cdot$}kg- 1, R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 10.60 g{$\cdot$}kg- 1), and organic soils (SOC {$>$} 120 g{$\cdot$}kg- 1, R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 62.31 g{$\cdot$}kg- 1). Spectral data preprocessing, particularly the first-order derivative, improved the performance of PLSR, RF, Ridge, KNN, and ANN, but not LSTM or CNN. We found that the SOC models of mineral and organic soils should be distinguished given their distinct spectral signatures. Finally, we identified that the shortwave infrared is vital for airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors to monitor surface SOC. This study highlights the high accuracy of LSTM with hyperspectral/multispectral data to mitigate a certain level of noise (soil moisture {$<$}0.4 m3{$\cdot$}m- 3, green leaf area {$<$} 0.3 m2{$\cdot$}m- 2, plant residue {$<$}0.4 m2{$\cdot$}m- 2) for quantifying surface SOC concentration. Forthcoming satellite hyperspectral missions like Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) have a high potential for future global soil carbon monitoring, while high-resolution satellite multispectral fusion data can be an alternative.},

  abstract = {At present, many Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods have been widely used for hyperspectral image classification. Promising classification results have been obtained by utilizing such models. However, due to the complexity and depth of the model, increasing the number of model parameters may lead to an overfitting of the model, especially when training data are insufficient. As the performance of the model mainly depends on sufficient data and a large network with reasonably optimized hyperparameters, using DNNs for classification requires better hardware conditions and sufficient training time. This paper proposes a feature fusion and multi-layered gradient boosting decision tree model (FF-DT) for hyperspectral image classification. First, we fuse extended morphology profiles (EMPs), linear multi-scale spatial characteristics, and nonlinear multiscale spatial characteristics as final features to extract both special and spectral features. Furthermore, a multi-layered gradient boosting decision tree model is constructed for classification. We conduct experiments based on three datasets, which in this paper are referred to as the Pavia University, Indiana Pines, and Salinas datasets. It is shown that the proposed FF-DT achieves better performance in classification accuracy, training conditions, and time consumption than other current classical hyperspectral image classification methods.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is becoming a very important tool for augmenting traditional spaceborne and airborne remote sensing techniques. Commercial RGB cameras are often the payload on UAVs, because they are inexpensive, easy to operate and require little data processing. RGB images are increasingly being used for mapping of fractional vegetation cover (FVC). However, the presence of significantly mixed pixels in close-range RGB images prevents the accurate estimation of FVC. Even where pixel unmixing is applied, limited quantitative spectral information and colour variability within these images could lead to profound errors and uncertainties. This paper proposes a colour mixture analysis (CMA) method based on the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) colour space to alleviate the above-mentioned concerns, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of FVC estimation from UAV-captured RGB images. First, the a priori colour information of the pure vegetation and background endmembers are extracted from the Hue channel of the UAV proximal sensing images, obviating ground-based image capture and the attendant cost and inconvenience. Second, the relationship between the probability distribution of mixed pixels and that of the two endmembers is estimated. Finally, we estimate FVC from UAV remote sensing images with a maximum a posteriori parameter (MAP) estimator. Two UAV-captured RGB image datasets and a synthetic RGB image dataset were used to test the new method. CMA was compared with three other FVC estimation algorithms, namely, FCLS, HAGFVC and LAB2. The FVC estimates by CMA were found to be highly accurate, with root mean squared errors (RMSE) of less than 0.007 and mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 0.01 for both field datasets. The accuracy was shown to be superior to that of all three algorithms. A comprehensive analysis of the estimation accuracy under various spatial resolutions and vegetation cover levels was conducted using both field and synthetic datasets. Results show that the CMA method can robustly and accurately estimate FVC across the full range of vegetation coverage and various resolutions. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of colour variability due to heterogeneity and shadow were also tested. Overall, CMA was shown to be robust to variation in colour and illumination.},

  abstract = {The estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) by using remote sensing images has become feasible. Based on Landsat8-OLI images and field data obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle, we established an empirical model (EM) and a pixel decomposition model (PDM) of FVC in the desert vegetation region, steppe vegetation region, meadow vegetation region and mixed vegetation region (the three vegetation region types) of the Qaidam Basin, and the inversion accuracies of the models were compared. The results show the following: (1) Vegetation classification inversion (VCI) provides a promising approach for FVC estimation. The accuracy of FVC by VCI was obviously better than that achieved using vegetation mixed inversion (VMI); (2) Differences were observed in the FVC estimation between VCI and VMI by the EM in areas with relatively high-density vegetation cover (FVC {$>$} 60\%). The FVC in some parts of steppe region in the basin was slightly overestimated by VMI of the EM; 3) VCI estimated by the PDM resulted in lower inversion values for extremely low-density vegetation cover (FVC {$\leq$} 10\%) and higher inversion values for high-density vegetation cover (FVC {$>$} 80\%). The FVC inversion was underestimated by the PDM in steppe and meadow regions with FVC {$>$} 15\% in the basin. The application of VCI in different models can provide new ideas for the sustainable study of vegetation in arid regions.},

In the meantime, convolutional neural network is utilized to automatically find spatial-related features at high levels. Then, the fusion feature is extracted by stacking spectral and spatial features together. Finally, the multiple-feature-based classifier is trained for image classification. Experimental results on well-known hyperspectral data sets show that the proposed SSFC method outperforms other commonly used methods for hyperspectral image classification.},

  abstract = {Modeling vegetation phenology is crucial to assessing how climate change impacts carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. The process-based biogeochemical model Biome-BGCMuSo is widely used for simulating carbon and water storages and fluxes of grassland ecosystems. However, the lack of accurate phenological information, such as the start of the growing season (SOS), impedes better simulations of the biogeochemical processes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Here, based on the snow-free satellite-derived SOS and the end of the growing season (EOS) in the TP during 1982\textendash 2018, we calibrated and validated three phenological models for SOS (i.e., the Biome-BGC phenological (BBGC) model, the heatsum growing season index (HSGSI) model, and the alpine meadow prognostic phenological (AMPP) model) and five phenological models for EOS (i.e., BBGC, HSGSI, AMPP, the low temperature and photoperiod multiplicative model induced by photoperiod (TPMP) and temperature (TPMT)) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For SOS, all three phenological models with calibrated parameters performed similarly and all captured the change in SOS well along gradients of aridity. The performance of BBGC, HSGSI, and AMPP models were largely improved with the calibration. The AMPP model simulated SOS with the lowest estimation errors with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 18.67 days and the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.47 in validation. For EOS, the calibrated HSGSI and AMPP models, with mean MAEs of 9.85 and 9.29 days, respectively, captured the change in EOS well along the gradients of aridity and performed better than other models. The calibration significantly improved the simulation performance of all five models. Therefore, the phenological models can be calibrated and validated at a large scale with snow-free satellite-derived phenological data. Our study recommends that calibration and validation for the phenological model play a vital role in accurately simulating SOS and EOS in the regional carbon cycle simulation.},
